# GA4-js

GA4-js is a collection of JavaScript snippets to help automate and standardise small tasks in Google Analytics 4.

## Installation

We might make a plugin in future, but at the moment the best thing to do is

- Select and copy the entirety of the file you want (descriptions of the files below).
- Create a new bookmark ([here's a guide if you need it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-bookmarklets/).)
- Paste the JavaScript into the URL of the bookmarklet


##Usage

To use your bookmarklet - go to a Google Analytics 4 property and then click the bookmarklet.
